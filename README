STILL IN EARLY STAGES OF DEV...

BibServer is a RESTful bibliographic data server.

Bibliographic files are stored in the BibJSON format - essentially JSON with a few 
conventions on what should be used as keys, and where certain types of information 
should be stored.

By default, the BibServer code runs a web service just like that available at 
http://bibsoup.net. It is possible to take the code and customise to provide 
the same functionality under a different brand, or on a local network if desired.

Records can be uploaded from bibTex, BibJSON, or CSV files, and will automatically 
generate a collection that can be browsed via the web site. Also, additional parsers 
can easily be written and used in your local version, or submitted for inclusion to 
the BibServer repository so others can use them too.

Collections can be browsed via the online service, and content negotiation can be 
performed to receive an HTML or JSON output. The search functionality utilises an 
underlying SOLR (moving to ES soon) index, and can be directly queried for responses.

BibServer uses code from some other projects (facetview and solreyes), but for ease 
of installation these have all been included in this repo. We have plans to develop 
further functionality, including being able to parse more source formats; installation 
information and development plans are being detailed on our web site at 
http://bibserver.okfn.org.
