	ABSTRACT = {Smoluchowski's coagulation equation describes the growth of clustering in a system in which clusters coalesce irreversibly by binary mergers. If the rate with which two objects merge is proportional to the sum of their masses, and the process starts with all clusters having the same mass initially (monodisperse initial conditions), then the growth of clustering in the system can be derived from a Poisson Galton-Watson branching process. The branching process is consistent with, and provides a more detailed description of gravitational clustering from Poisson initial conditions than, the excursion set, Press-Schechter approach. The correspondence between the branching process and additive coagulation schemes is used to efficiently simulate realizations of the merger history tree. These results are easily extended to describe clustering from white-noise Gaussian initial conditions. Extending this approach to describe clustering from Gaussian fields with arbitrary power spectra is more complicated. To illustrate this, Smoluchowski's additive coagulation equation with arbitrary discrete initial conditions is solved. The result is used to argue that if Smoluchowski's equation is to describe the growth of clustering from arbitrary Gaussian fluctuation fields, and if it is to be consistent with the excursion set results, then the merger rule must depend on the power spectrum. However, with the exception of the white-noise case, the excursion set approach is formally inconsistent with the binary merger assumption, although, for all power spectra of current interest, binary mergers remain a reasonable approximation. This means that, except for the white-noise case, an analogue of the Smoluchowski coagulation approach cannot provide a description of clustering that is exactly equivalent to the excursion set description. Nevertheless, since binary mergers remain a good approximation, Smoluchowski's equation, with a merger rate that can be determined from the excursion set approach, so that it is a calculable function of the power spectrum, can provide a useful approximate description of the growth of clustering},

ABSTRACT = {Consider the radial projection onto the unit sphere of the path a
d-dimensional Brownian motion W, started at the center of the sphere and run
for unit time. Given the occupation measure mu of this projected path, what can
be said about the terminal point W(1), or about the range of the original path?
In any dimension, for each Borel set A subseteq S^{d-1}, the conditional
probability that the projection of W(1) is in A given mu(A) is just mu(A).
Nevertheless, in dimension d>=3, both the range and the terminal point of W can
be recovered with probability 1 from mu. In particular, for d>=3 the
conditional law of the projection of W(1) given mu is not mu. In dimension~2 we
conjecture that the projection of W(1) cannot be recovered almost surely from
mu, and show that the conditional law of the projection of W(1) given mu is not
mu.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper reviews known results which connect Riemann's integral
representations of his zeta function, involving Jacobi's theta function and its
derivatives, to some particular probability laws governing sums of independent
exponential variables. These laws are related to one-dimensional Brownian
motion and to higher dimensional Bessel processes. We present some
characterizations of these probability laws, and some approximations of
Riemann's zeta function which are related to these laws.},

ABSTRACT = {We define an n-dimensional polytope Pi_n(x), depending on parameters x_i>0,
whose combinatorial properties are closely connected with empirical
distributions, plane trees, plane partitions, parking functions, and the
associahedron. In particular, we give explicit formulas for the volume of
Pi_n(x) and, when the x_i's are integers, the number of integer points in
Pi_n(x). We give two polyhedral decompositions of Pi_n(x), one related to order
cones of posets and the other to the associahedron.},

ABSTRACT = {A new class of random composition structures (the ordered analog of Kingman's partition structures) is defined by a regenerative description of component sizes. Each regenerative composition structure is represented by a process of random sampling of points from an exponential distribution on the positive halfline, and separating the points into clusters by an independent regenerative random set. Examples are composition structures derived from residual allocation models, including one associated with the Ewens sampling formula, and composition structures derived from the zero set of a Brownian motion or Bessel process. We provide characterisation results and formulas relating the distribution of the regenerative composition to the L{\'e}vy parameters of a subordinator whose range is the corresponding regenerative set. In particular, the only reversible regenerative composition structures are those associated with the interval partition of $[0,1]$ generated by excursions of a standard Bessel bridge of dimension $2 - 2 \alpha$ for some $\alpha \in [0,1]$.},

We give a description of the exploration process, a function defined on [0,1] that encodes the structure of an ICRT, and also of its width process, determining the size of layers in order of height. These processes turn out to be transformations of bridges with exchangeable increments, which have already appeared in other ICRT related topics such as stochastic additive coalescence. The results rely on two different constructions of birthday trees from processes with exchangeable increments, on weak convergence arguments, and on general theory on continuum random trees. },

We associate each regenerative partition structure with a corresponding regenerative composition structure, which (as we showed in a previous paper) can be associated in turn with a regenerative random subset of the positive halfline, that is the closed range of a subordinator. A general regenerative partition structure is thus represented in terms of the Laplace exponent of an associated subordinator. We also analyse deletion properties characteristic of the two-parameter family of partition structures.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we study random partitions of 1,...n, where every cluster of size j can be in any of w\_j possible internal states. The Gibbs (n,k,w) distribution is obtained by sampling uniformly among such partitions with k clusters. We provide conditions on the weight sequence w allowing construction of a partition valued random process where at step k the state has the Gibbs (n,k,w) distribution, so the partition is subject to irreversible fragmentation as time evolves. For a particular one-parameter family of weight sequences w\_j, the time-reversed process is the discrete Marcus-Lushnikov coalescent process with affine collision rate K\_{i,j}=a+b(i+j) for some real numbers a and b. Under further restrictions on a and b, the fragmentation process can be realized by conditioning a Galton-Watson tree with suitable offspring distribution to have n nodes, and cutting the edges of this tree by random sampling of edges without replacement, to partition the tree into a collection of subtrees. Suitable offspring distributions include the binomial, negative binomial and Poisson distributions.},

	ABSTRACT = {The real trees form a class of metric spaces that extends the class of trees with edge lengths by allowing behavior such as infinite total edge length and vertices with infinite branching degree. Aldous's Brownian continuum random tree, the random tree-like object naturally associated with a standard Brownian excursion, may be thought of as a random compact real tree. The continuum random tree is a scaling limit as N tends to infinity of both a critical Galton-Watson tree conditioned to have total population size N as well as a uniform random rooted combinatorial tree with N vertices. The Aldous--Broder algorithm is a Markov chain on the space of rooted combinatorial trees with N vertices that has the uniform tree as its stationary distribution. We construct and study a Markov process on the space of all rooted compact real trees that has the continuum random tree as its stationary distribution and arises as the scaling limit as N tends to infinity of the Aldous--Broder chain. A key technical ingredient in this work is the use of a pointed Gromov--Hausdorff distance to metrize the space of rooted compact real trees.},

  ABSTRACT = {For two collections of nonnegative and suitably normalised weights $W(j)$ and $V(n,k)$, a probability distribution on the set of partitions of the set $\{1,...,n\}$ is defined by assigning to a generic partition $\{A_j, j\leq k\}$ the probability $V(n,k) W(|A_1|)... W(|A_k|)$, where $|A_j|$ is the number of elements of $A_j$. We impose constraints on the weights by assuming that the resulting random partitions $\Pi_n$ of $[n]$ are consistent as $n$ varies, meaning that they define an exchangeable partition of the set of all natural numbers. This implies that the weights $W$ must be of a very special form depending on a single parameter $\alpha\in [-\infty,1]$. The case $\alpha=1$ is trivial, and for each value of $\alpha\neq 1$ the set of possible $V$-weights is an infinite-dimensional simplex. We identify the extreme points of the simplex by solving the boundary problem for a generalised Stirling triangle. In particular, we show that the boundary is discrete for $-\infty\leq\alpha<0$ and continuous for $0\leq\alpha<1$. For $\alpha\leq 0$ the extremes correspond to the members of the Ewens-Pitman family of random partitions indexed by $(\alpha,\theta)$, while for $0<\alpha<1$ the extremes are obtained by conditioning an $(\alpha,\theta)$-partition on the asymptotics of the number of blocks of $\Pi_n$ as $n$ tends to infinity.},

Two different ways to encode a mapping as a walk lead to two different decompositions of the Brownian bridge, each defined by cutting the path of the bridge at an increasing sequence of recursively defined random times in the zero set of the bridge. The random mapping asymptotics entail some remarkable identities involving the random occupation measures of the bridge fragments defined by these decompositions. We derive various extensions of these identities for Brownian and Bessel bridges, and characterize the distributions of various path fragments involved, using the theory of Poisson processes of excursions for a self-similar Markov process whose zero set is the range of a stable subordinator of index between 0 and 1.},

distribution given by independent exponential distributions with varying means.
We also study one particular countably infinite system, where only the minimum
Brownian particle gets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and
identically distributed exponential spacings remain stationary under the
dynamics of such a process.
Some related conjectures in this direction have also been discussed.},

TITLE = {Coloured loop-erased random walk on the complete graph},
ABSTRACT = {Starting from a sequence regarded as a walk through some set of values, we
consider the associated loop-erased walk as a sequence of directed edges, with
an edge from $i$ to $j$ if the loop erased walk makes a step from $i$ to $j$.
We introduce a coloring of these edges by painting edges with a fixed color as
long as the walk does not loop back on itself, then switching to a new color
whenever a loop is erased, with each new color distinct from all previous
colors. The pattern of colors along the edges of the loop-erased walk then
displays stretches of consecutive steps of the walk left untouched by the
loop-erasure process. Assuming that the underlying sequence generating the
loop-erased walk is a sequence of independent random variables, each uniform on
$[N]:={1, 2, ..., N}$, we condition the walk to start at $N$ and stop the
walk when it first reaches the subset $[k]$, for some $1 \leq k \leq N-1$. We
relate the distribution of the random length of this loop-erased walk to the
distribution of the length of the first loop of the walk, via Cayley's
enumerations of trees, and via Wilson's algorithm. For fixed $N$ and $k$, and
$i = 1,2, ...$, let $B_i$ denote the event that the loop-erased walk from $N$
to $[k]$ has $i +1$ or more edges, and the $i^{th}$ and $(i+1)^{th}$ of these
edges are colored differently. We show that given that the loop-erased random
walk has $j$ edges for some $1\leq j \leq N-k$, the events $B_i$ for $1 \leq i
\leq j-1$ are independent, with the probability of $B_i$ equal to $1/(k+i+1)$.
This determines the distribution of the sequence of random lengths of
differently colored segments of the loop-erased walk, and yields asymptotic
descriptions of these random lengths as $N \to \infty$.},

M{ö}hle described the recursion which determines the generalization of the
Ewens sampling formula in the situation when the lines of descent are governed
by a $\Lambda$-coalescent, which allows multiple mergers. Here we show that the
basic integral representation of transition rates for the $\Lambda$-coalescent
is forced by sampling consistency under more general assumptions on the
coalescent process. Exploiting an analogy with the theory of regenerative
partition structures, we provide various characterizations of the associated
partition structures in terms of discrete-time Markov chains.},

be regarded as encoding some kind of infinite tree, with each upward excursion of the path corresponding to a subtree.

A branching process is a probability measure on trees. The purpose of the present section is to show that walks and trees are abstractly identical objects and to give probabilistic consequences of this correspondence. The identity referred to is nonprobabilistic and is quite distinct from the fact that a branching process, as a Markov process, may be considered in a certain sense to be a random walk, and also distinct from the fact that each step of the random walk, having two possible directions, represents a two fold branching.},

We use a natural ordered extension of the Chinese Restaurant Process to grow a two-parameter family of binary self-similar continuum fragmentation trees. We provide an explicit embedding of Ford's sequence of alpha model trees in the continuum tree which we identified in a previous article as a distributional scaling limit of Ford's trees. In general, the Markov branching trees induced by the two-parameter growth rule are not sampling consistent, so the existence of compact limiting trees cannot be deduced from previous work on the sampling consistent case. We develop here a new approach to establish such limits, based on regenerative interval partitions and the urn-model description of sampling from Dirichlet random distributions.

ABSTRACT = {We prove a long-standing conjecture which characterises the Ewens-Pitman two-parameter family of exchangeable random partitions, plus a short list of limit and exceptional cases, by the following property: for each $n = 2,3, >...$, if one of $n$ individuals is chosen uniformly at random, independently of the random partition $\pi_n$ of these individuals into various types, and all individuals of the same type as the chosen individual are deleted, then for each $r > 0$, given that $r$ individuals remain, these individuals are partitioned according to $\pi_r'$ for some sequence of random partitions $(\pi_r')$ that does not depend on $n$ or $r$. An analogous result characterizes the associated Poisson-Dirichlet family of random discrete distributions by an independence property related to random deletion of a frequency chosen by a size-biased pick. We also survey the regenerative properties of members of the two-parameter family, and settle a question regarding the explicit arrangement of intervals with lengths given by the terms of the Poisson-Dirichlet random sequence into the interval partition induced by the range of a neutral-to-the right process.
