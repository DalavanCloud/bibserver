        <h2>More information</h2>
        <p>We use the <a href="http://bibjson.org">BibJSON</a> conventions for storing and sharing bibliographic references, 
        so in order to upload records, you need a JSON file containing records that meet those conventions.</p>
        
        <p>If you do not want to manually create such a file, you can use an 
        <a href="#">online conversion service</a> to do it for you.</p>
        
        <p>Once you have a suitable file, either place it online somewhere and note 
        down the URL address, or store it on your own PC; then you can use it as your source file.</p>
        
        <p>Your uploaded records can be automatically added to one of your collections, 
        so that you will see your records appear in that collection as they are processed.</p>
        
        <!--<p>You will receive an email once the processing is complete.</p>-->
